# VLSI-LAB-EXP-5
# SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF FINITE STATE MACHINE

# AIM: 
To simulate and synthesis finite state machine using Xilinx ISE.

# **APPARATUS REQUIRED:**

Xilinx 14.7 
Spartan6 FPGA

# **PROCEDURE:**
```
STEP:1 Start the Xilinx navigator, Select and Name the New project.
STEP:2 Select the device family, device, package and speed. 
STEP:3 Select new source in the New Project and select Verilog Module as the Source type. 
STEP:4 Type the File Name and Click Next and then finish button. Type the code and save it. 
STEP:5 Select the Behavioral Simulation in the Source Window and click the check syntax. 
STEP:6 Click the simulation to simulate the program and give the inputs and verify the outputs as per the truth table. 
STEP:7 Select the Implementation in the Sources Window and select the required file in the Processes Window. 
STEP:8 Select Check Syntax from the Synthesize XST Process. Double Click in the Floorplan Area/IO/Logic-Post Synthesis process in the User Constraints process group. UCF(User constraint File) is obtained. 
STEP:9 In the Design Object List Window, enter the pin location for each pin in the Loc column Select save from the File menu. 
STEP:10 Double click on the Implement Design and double click on the Generate Programming File to create a bitstream of the design.(.v) file is converted into .bit file here. 
STEP:11 On the board, by giving required input, the LEDs starts to glow light, indicating the output.
STEP:12 Load the Bit file into the SPARTAN 6 FPGA

# VERILOG CODE:
```
module fsm(clk, rst, x, z);
input clk, rst, x;
output z;
reg [2:1] present_state, NEXT_STATE;
parameter S0=2'b00, S1=2'b01, S2=2'b10, S3=2'b11;
always@(x,present_state)
case(present_state)
S0: if(x)
NEXT_STATE=S1;
else
NEXT_STATE=S0;
S1: if(x)
NEXT_STATE=S1;
else
NEXT_STATE=S2;
S2: if(x)
NEXT_STATE=S3;
else
NEXT_STATE=S0;
S3: if(x)
NEXT_STATE=S1;
else
NEXT_STATE=S2;
endcase
always@(negedge rst, posedge clk)
if(rst)
present_state<=S0;
else
present_state<=NEXT_STATE;
assign z=(present_state==S3);
endmodule
```
# OUTPUT WAVEFORM:

# RESULT:
Hence the simulation and synthesis of finite state machine by using vivado has been successfully excecuted and verified.
